# Happy Thoughts

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
For week seven of the Technigo bootcamp (week three of the React sprint) our assignment was to create a "twitter-like" web app to practice fetching and posting to APIs.

## The problem

Using mainly React and CSS I have built a message field from a given design. The app contains various components responsile for specific tasks, for example posting messages or "likes" to the API endpoint. In this project both posting a new message and updating how many times a messages have been liked is done using the POST method.

To create this app I have made one component (with placeholder text) at a time, first setting the css to match the design and then adding the functionality. If i had more time I would have added some animations for when a new message is sent to the API.
